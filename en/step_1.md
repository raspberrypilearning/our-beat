The speaker output is only available on the V2 micro:bit. You will need to connect external headphones/speakers to play sound on the V1. You will still be able to play the sound on the simulator.

Here is a [guide to connecting headphones/speakers to the V1 micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hack-your-headphones/make){:target="_blank"}.
